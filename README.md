# RASTE
This is a Rhythm-aware Adaptive Spectral-Temporal Enhancement method(RASTE). It adaptively extracts rhythmic characteristics from underwater acoustic signals, providing information on target shaft frequency and blade count without requiring manual bandwidth selection. This model remains applicable to non-stationary signals.
